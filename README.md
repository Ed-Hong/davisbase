CS 6360.5U1 - Database Design: Project 

## TODO
### Features required for Part 1:
* INSERT - working

* CREATE TABLE - working

* SELECT - working

* SHOW TABLES - working;

## BUGS
### In order of decreasing priority:
* Parser Logic for INSERT: `create table tbl ( c1 int , c2 text );` should just be `create table tbl (c1 int, c2 text);`

* On small screens, or when your column count is very large, the print formatting is messy (not sure if we should really be concerned about this).
