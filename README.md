CS 6360.5U1 - Database Design: Project 

## TODO
### Features required for Part 1:
* Create Table
... 7/18: Implemented by Hua; Testing thus far seems good.

* Insert Record 
... 7/18: _Work in progress_ see PR #5.

* Query record(s) without a where clause - ie: SELECT [* or column_list] FROM [table name];
... 7/18: SELECT * seems to work, need further testing and need to test selecting individual columns.

* List all tables - ie: SHOW TABLES;
... 7/18: Tested and in working order.
